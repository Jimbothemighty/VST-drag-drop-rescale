# Application Template Readme

# VST Interview task

## Overview
- Drag on click following mouse
- Resize on pinch-zoom
- Boundary limits (20px from edge)
- Screen resize enforces boundaries (although will overflow if window is smaller than element size)
- Min / Max scale to *4 and /4
- Smooth glide to centre on button press

# Running the project
- Download code
- Open in VSCode / Terminal
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`

# Notes
- I ran this in host mode so it exposed over 192.168 so I could test via my phone

# Issues
- I think on first click then the drag is not initiating for some reason. But its a barely noticable issue.
